EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Paul Meyers is a 62-year-old digital marketing agency owner based in North Bay, Ontario, serving contractors and home service professionals. After 22+ years in automotive sales—rising from salesperson to General Manager at North Bay Toyota—Paul pivoted to digital marketing in 2018 and launched his own agency, PM Consulting Inc., in April 2025.

In his first 8 months, Paul generated $300,000 in sales. His mission is to help contractors stop losing leads through his proprietary "Zero Lead Loss" system—a 5-pillar program combining smart websites, CRM automation, AI-powered communication tools, database reactivation, and automated review generation.

Paul is driven by a lifelong dream to become the first millionaire in his family. He watched his father work 12-hour days as an entrepreneur without ever achieving financial freedom, and he's determined to break that pattern. At 62, with his wife Julie of 40 years, three successful daughters, and a precious granddaughter, Paul is racing against time to build the "perpetual money-making machine" he's envisioned since youth.

His superpower is his energy, authenticity, and relentless drive to deliver real results—not marketing fluff. His hill to die on: "I won't sell smoke. If I can't move the needle, I'll tell you."

ORIGIN STORY
Early Years
Paul was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and moved to North Bay at age 8-9 when his father took a job managing a twin-pad indoor ice arena. This gave young Paul unlimited access to ice time, and he became a dominant hockey player until around age 15, when his priorities shifted.

Growing up, Paul was a self-described "rink rat"—cocky, immature, always showing off. He experienced sexual abuse as a child at the arena, something he compartmentalized and is only now beginning to acknowledge. He has self-diagnosed ADHD, which explains his lifelong challenges with focus and concentration, as well as his restless energy.
Family & Money Messages
Paul's father was a serial entrepreneur—managing arenas, running an Italian restaurant called Caesar's, operating lottery concessions and gift shops in a mall, running an engraving business. The whole family worked together, often 12-hour days. But despite the hustle, they never got rich. The landlord (the mall) captured the real value.

His mother was a strong, outspoken Italian woman who managed the Imperial Motor Hotel. Paul suspects her forcefulness masked deep insecurity. She recently passed away; his father died in 2017.

Paul has one older sister (by 2 years) who absorbed similar lessons about work and money.
"I want to be the first millionaire in the family. I want to show everyone I made it."
This dream crystallized early and persists today. It's not just about money—it's about proof, validation, and breaking the pattern of hard work without reward.
Education
Formal education was a failure. In an all-boys school, Paul was smoking and selling drugs. Grade 9: 2 credits out of 9. Grade 10: 1 credit out of 9. He switched schools in Grade 11 and dropped out halfway through to work with his dad at the mall.

Paul never had a clear career aspiration—just the drive to be financially successful. The vehicle was always secondary to the destination.

Positioning: Zero Lead Loss
"Contractors don't need more leads—they need to stop losing the ones they have."
This reframes the conversation from "buy more ads" to "fix your bucket first." It's immediately understandable to contractors who feel the pain of missed calls and dead leads.
Sales Philosophy
• Money loves speed
• Follow up till they tell you to fuck off
• Treat everyone with respect
• Answer your phone. Call back in 5 minutes.

Contrarian Position
"Customers want ROI. They want fucking results, not marketing fluff and bullshit fancy talk about positioning and branding. They want SALES. They want the needle to move. Agencies hide behind almost anything."

Ideal Client Profile
Contractors and home service pros (plumbers, HVAC, renovations, etc.) doing $1M–$5M in annual revenue. They're past survival mode but drowning in chaos—busy enough that they need systems, but disorganized enough that leads slip through the cracks.

They can afford to invest because they have revenue. They need to invest because they're losing money every day they don't fix the leakage.

The Emotional Transformation
FROM: Frustrated, overwhelmed, drowning in emails/calls/disconnected tech, working 60-hour weeks, scared it could fall apart, feeling like the business owns them.

TO: Calls answered, leads nurtured, reviews flowing, peace of mind, time back, weekends back, confidence, control, freedom, pride, hope.

"Sell the outcome, not the tool. Nobody cares about the drill—they just want the hole."

VALUES, BELIEFS & WORLDVIEW
Core Values
Value
How It Shows Up
Family First
Wife, 3 daughters, 3 son-in-laws, 5 pets, 1 granddaughter. They're the why behind everything.
Integrity
Do what you say, when you say. No excuses.
Respect
Treat everyone right—and expect the same in return.
Results Over Bullshit
Deliver real value. No fluff, no posturing, no hiding.
Generosity
Go above and beyond. Help people. Big heart.
Trust Your Gut
"How it starts is how it ends." Honor the red flags.

Core Beliefs
On Money:
"Money is NOT the root of all evil. Not having money is."
Paul loves money and isn't ashamed of it. He believes in manifestation and the power of the subconscious. He's inspired by wealthy people, not threatened by them.

On Contractors:
They're good people. Family men grinding every day for their families AND their employees. They deserve someone in their corner.

On Hard Work:
Hard work alone doesn't create wealth—his dad proved that. You need to work smart: go deep, become a specialist, charge what you're worth.

On His Industry:
Digital marketing is full of scammers with low barriers to entry. There should be certification requirements. The grifters make it harder for people who actually deliver.

The Hill He'll Die On
"I won't sell smoke. If I can't move the needle, I'll tell you."

Legacy Statement
"He was a hard worker, a good manager, a good person, and passionate about what he did."

GOALS, CHALLENGES & CURRENT STATE
Business Goals
Timeframe
Goal
90 Days
5 new CRM clients @ $500/month + $2,000 setup = $2,500 new MRR + $10,000 one-time
2026
$400,000 total revenue
Monthly Target
$50,000/month (MRR + one-time combined)
3 Years (age 65)
Slow down, possibly transition to online coaching

The Math
To hit $50K/month MRR: 100 clients @ $500/month. At 20% close rate: 500 presentations needed. Paul can't visualize that volume yet—and that may be part of the block.

Current Challenges
• Not enough leads, conversations, presentations, opportunities
• Same problem his clients have—lead flow
• BNI works but doesn't scale; ads have flopped; hates cold calling
• Fear of niching further—local market too small for hyper-niche
• Can't visualize the path to 100 clients

Skills Actively Developing
• Claude Code and AI assistants
• AI tools and agentic workflows
• Automations and lead nurturing
• Video production

Growth Edge
Paul is building toward the machine—the system that generates and nurtures leads without manual effort. He's closer than ever to the "make money from a computer" dream, but hasn't snapped all the pieces together yet.
