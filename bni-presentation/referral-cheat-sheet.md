# BNI Referral Cheat Sheet — Paul Meyers / Zero Lead Loss

**One-page reminder for BNI members:** who to refer, what to listen for, and how to introduce Paul.

---

## Who to refer

- **Contractors and home service pros** — plumbers, HVAC, renovators, roofers, electricians, etc.
- **Revenue:** roughly **$1M–$5M** per year (past survival mode, have budget; drowning in chaos).
- **The sweet spot:** They’re **already spending on marketing** (ads, website, etc.) but **don’t have a real system** for answering leads, following up, or reactivating old customers.

## What to listen for (phrases that mean “refer Paul”)

When a contractor or home service pro says things like this, think of Paul:

- *"I'm spending on ads but it's not working."*
- *"I miss half my calls."* / *"I can't answer when I'm on the job."*
- *"I'm drowning in quotes and follow-ups."*
- *"I have a list of old customers I never get to."* / *"We never follow up on past leads."*
- *"My website doesn't do anything."* / *"We get leads but they go nowhere."*
- *"We're busy but it's chaos."* / *"I don't have time to follow up."*

## How to introduce Paul (script you can use)

**Short version:**  
*"I know someone who helps contractors stop losing leads—he says 'fix the bucket before you buy more water.' Can I connect you?"*

**If they ask what he does:**  
*"He sets up systems so you don’t miss calls, don’t lose form fills, and actually follow up on old leads and customers. So you get more jobs without necessarily spending more on ads."*

## Why the referral would care

They’re not doing Paul a favor—**they’re leaking money**. Missed calls and dead leads = ad spend and effort wasted. Paul helps them plug the leaks so they book more work and get their time back. You’re doing your contact a favor by connecting them.
