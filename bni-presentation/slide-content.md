# BNI 10-Minute Presentation: Slide Content

Use slides as a visual aid—minimal text, no reading line-by-line. You speak the detail; slides reinforce.

---

## Slide 1 — Title & Promise

**Visual:** Clean title slide.

**Text on slide:**
- **Zero Lead Loss for Contractors**
- Fix the bucket before you buy more water.
- Paul Meyers | PM Consulting Inc. / Contractor Marketing Engine

**You say:** Hook + who you are in one sentence. No bullet reading.

---

## Slide 2 — The Ugly Truth

**Visual:** Simple graphic—leaky bucket, or funnel with holes and “lost” labels. One stat if desired.

**Text on slide:**
- Most contractors are losing the leads they already have.
- Missed calls. Form fills that sit. Old customers never contacted again.

**Optional stat (if you use one):**  
- *"Half of leads unanswered = half your ad spend in the trash."*

**You say:** The chaos story—busy contractor, missed call, homeowner calls someone else. Keep it short.

---

## Slide 3 — Contractor Story (Before / After)

**Visual:** Two columns or a simple before → after flow.

**Text on slide:**

**Before**
- Missed calls, slow callbacks
- Leads in inbox, no follow-up
- Old database sitting unused
- Business owns them

**After**
- Calls answered (human or AI)
- Leads nurtured automatically
- Database reactivated = revenue
- Time back. Weekends back.

**You say:** One sentence per side. "This is the transformation. Not more dashboards—results."

---

## Slide 4 — The 5 Pillars (High Level)

**Visual:** Five icons or short labels in a row or grid. Very little text.

**Text on slide (short labels only):**
1. **Smart Website** — Capture, nurture, close
2. **Database Reactivation** — Unlock dormant revenue
3. **Reviews AI** — Steady Google reviews
4. **Voice AI** — 24/7 phone answer & book
5. **Conversational AI** — Catch leads that would bounce

**You say:** One sentence per pillar from your talking points. Do not read the slide verbatim.

---

## Slide 5 — Case Result Snapshot

**Visual:** One big number + 2–3 short bullets. No paragraphs.

**Text on slide:**
- **$400,000** from old leads
- Kitchen renovation company
- 2,500 in database → reactivation campaign → 12 closed
- No new ads. Just follow-up.

**You say:** "One client. Two thousand five hundred people they'd already talked to. We woke them up. Twelve signed. Four hundred thousand. The money was already there."

---

## Slide 6 — Perfect Referral Cheat Sheet

**Visual:** Simple three-part layout: Who | What to listen for | What to say.

**Text on slide:**

**Who:** Contractor / home service pro, $1M–$5M revenue, busy but chaotic

**Listen for:**  
- "I'm spending on ads but it's not working"  
- "I miss half my calls"  
- "I'm drowning in follow-ups"  
- "I have old customers I never contact"

**Intro script:**  
"I know someone who helps contractors stop losing leads—fix the bucket before you buy more water. Can I connect you?"

**You say:** Walk through each part once. "Make it easy for yourself—use that script."

---

## Slide 7 — BNI Alignment & Benefits

**Visual:** 2–3 short bullets. Optional: BNI Givers Gain® or “Changing the Way the World Does Business” if you have a graphic.

**Text on slide:**
- **Givers Gain:** You're helping a contractor get their life back—not just passing a lead.
- **Building relationships:** Sending someone who delivers strengthens your relationship with that contractor.
- **Accountability:** I follow up. I don't let introductions die.

**You say:** One line per value. "When you refer me, you're living what BNI stands for."

---

## Slide 8 — Recap & Single Ask

**Visual:** Three recap bullets + one clear ask + contact.

**Text on slide:**

**Recap**
1. Zero Lead Loss — 5 pillars for contractors who are losing leads.
2. Ideal referral: $1M–$5M, busy, spending on marketing, leaking leads.
3. Listen for: "Ads aren't working," "I miss calls," "Drowning in follow-up."

**My ask:** One introduction to a contractor who's spending on marketing but doesn't have a system for follow-up.

**Contact:** [Your phone / email / contractormarketingengine.ca]

**You say:** Recap in your own words, state the single ask, thank them, and close. "Questions—catch me after. I want you to remember: fix the bucket before you buy more water."
