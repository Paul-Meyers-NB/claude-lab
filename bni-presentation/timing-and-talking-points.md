# BNI 10-Minute Presentation: Section-by-Section Timing & Talking Points

**Topic:** Zero Lead Loss for Contractors  
**Total time:** 10 minutes  
**Voice:** Direct, conversational, results-focused. No jargon. Light profanity only if it fits the room.

---

## 0:00–1:00 — Hook & Context

**Goal:** Grab attention immediately. No personal bio. Tie to BNI so members see why this matters to them.

**Talking points:**
- Open with a bold line: *"Most contractors are setting fire to their leads. They're paying for ads, getting calls—and then losing those people because nobody answers, nobody follows up, and the 'system' is a mess."*
- One sentence on what you do: *"I help contractors stop losing the leads they already have. Fix the bucket before you buy more water."*
- BNI tie-in: *"When you introduce me to a contractor who's drowning in chaos, you're not just giving me a referral—you're giving them a way to get their life back. That's Givers Gain. You're helping someone in your network win."*

**Do not:** Spend time on family, hobbies, or background. Save that for one-on-ones.

## 1:00–3:00 — The Problem: Zero Lead Loss Gap

**Goal:** Paint the typical contractor reality so everyone in the room can picture it—and so they recognize the type of person to refer.

**Talking points:**
- Describe the chaos: *"Picture a contractor doing a million to five million a year. They're busy. Phone rings, they're on a ladder or in a crawl space. They miss the call. Maybe they call back in three hours—or tomorrow. By then the homeowner's already called two other guys. That lead is gone."*
- Add the numbers angle: *"If they're spending two grand a month on ads and only answering half their leads, they're literally throwing a thousand dollars a month in the trash. And that's just the calls. What about the form fills that sit in an inbox for two days? The old customers who'd come back if someone just reached out?"*
- Land the emotional beat: *"These are good people. Family men. They're grinding for their crews and their kids. They don't need more marketing fluff—they need someone to help them stop the leak."*

**Optional stat to drop:** *"One of my clients had 2,500 people in their database—past leads and customers—sitting there. We reactivated them. Twelve closed. Four hundred thousand in revenue. That money was already there. They just weren't answering the phone."* (Can slide into next section if you're tight on time.)

## 3:00–6:00 — Your Solution: 5-Pillar Zero Lead Loss System

**Goal:** Name the system, give one clear line per pillar, then tell one strong story. No feature dumps.

**Talking points:**
- Frame: *"I built something I call Zero Lead Loss. Five pillars. I'll give you the short version."*
- **Smart Website:** *"A site that actually gets found and turns visitors into leads—forms that trigger follow-up automatically so nothing sits in an inbox."*
- **Database Reactivation:** *"SMS and email campaigns to wake up past leads and old customers. That's where the four hundred thousand came from—people they'd already talked to once."*
- **Reviews AI:** *"Automated system to get Google reviews. Reviews are the number-one ranking factor. Contractors need a steady flow without begging."*
- **Voice AI:** *"A bot that answers the phone 24/7, sounds human, and books appointments when they can't pick up."*
- **Conversational AI:** *"Chat on the website that catches people who would have bounced. Converts them instead of losing them."*
- **One story:** *"That kitchen reno company—2,500 people in the database, mostly cold. We ran a reactivation campaign. Twelve signed. Four hundred thousand in revenue. No new ads. Just following up on what they already had."*
- Transformation line: *"The outcome isn't more dashboards—it's calls answered, leads nurtured, time back. Weekends back. They stop feeling like the business owns them."*

**Do not:** Go deep on tech (GoHighLevel, etc.). Say "CRM and automations" if asked; keep the focus on results.

## 6:00–8:00 — How BNI Members Can Spot and Introduce Ideal Referrals

**Goal:** Make it stupid-easy to know who to refer and what to say. One primary type, a few phrases they might hear, and a script.

**Talking points:**
- Who you want: *"Ideal referral: a contractor or home service pro—plumber, HVAC, renovator, roofer—doing roughly a million to five million a year. Busy but chaotic. Spending money on marketing and either not tracking leads or knowing they're losing them."*
- What to listen for: *"They might say things like: 'I'm spending on ads but it's not working.' 'I miss half my calls.' 'I'm drowning in quotes and follow-ups.' 'I have a list of old customers I never get to.' 'My website doesn't do anything.' When you hear that—think of me."*
- The script: *"When you introduce us, you can say something like: 'I know someone who helps contractors stop losing leads—fix the bucket before you buy more water. Can I connect you?' That's it. I'll take it from there."*
- Why the referral would care: *"They're not meeting me to do me a favor. They're meeting me because they're leaking money and they want it to stop. You're doing them a favor by connecting them."*

---

## 8:00–9:00 — What's in It for Their Referrals (and for BNI Members)

**Goal:** Reinforce outcomes and tie to BNI values so the referral feels like a natural part of "changing the way we do business."

**Talking points:**
- For the contractor: *"They get more booked jobs without necessarily spending more on ads. Fewer missed calls. Less chaos. Time back with their family. Confidence that the system is working instead of hoping nothing falls through the cracks."*
- For the member: *"When you send me a contractor who's a good fit, you're building a stronger relationship with that person—because you sent them someone who actually delivers. That's building relationships. And I hold myself accountable: I follow up. I don't let introductions die. That's how we both win."*

---

## 9:00–10:00 — Recap, Single Ask, and Close

**Goal:** Last thing they hear is your recap and your one ask. No open Q&A at the end—you control the close.

**Talking points:**
- Recap in three bullets: *"One: I help contractors and home service pros stop losing leads—Zero Lead Loss, five pillars. Two: ideal referral is a million to five million in revenue, busy but chaotic, spending on marketing and losing leads. Three: when you hear 'I'm spending on ads but it's not working' or 'I miss half my calls'—that's your cue. Connect us."*
- Single ask: *"My ask this week: if you know a contractor who's already spending on marketing but doesn't have a real system for following up—introduce us. One introduction. I'll take care of the rest."*
- Close: *"Questions are welcome—catch me after the meeting or shoot me a message. I don't want the last thing you remember to be someone else's question. I want you to remember: fix the bucket before you buy more water. Thank you."*

**Do not:** Allocate the last two minutes to open Q&A. Take 1–2 quick yes/no questions in the middle if you want engagement; end on your message.
